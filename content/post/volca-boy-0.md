Volca Boy is a modding project aimed at turning a 1989 Game Boy into a portable synthesizer/sequencer. Although most of the work is original and designed by me, I borrowed some mods and code from other open source projects. In that case, I will give all the necessary credits to the modders from which I borrowed. This project is open source too, so feel free to try it, modify it, add and remove things to it as you like. 
   
The links will appear as the project progresses and the steps get documented.
