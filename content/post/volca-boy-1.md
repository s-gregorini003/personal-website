## A Bit of Context

### Chiptune 

For those unfamiliar with the term, *chiptune* (also known as chipmusic, micromusic or 8-bit music) is a style of electronic music derived from the sound chips that, in the first generation of computers and gaming consoles, were used to balance the processing power of generating sound effects and music from the CPU. 

Like everything nowadays, that definition can be interpreted in many ways. In its strictiest meaning, chiptune is used to refer to music created entirely from the original, vintage audio chips (nevertheless, modifications that do not alter the nature of the sound produced are "allowed", but we'll come back to this later). On the other hand, the broadest definition is more related to the aesthetics of the sound, rather then to the source generating it.

>The primal micromusic spirit was to overcome limitations and wield them in wildly creative ways. - [Fabio "Kenobit" Bortolotti][1]

"What are these first generation gaming consoles? You may ask

However, this project will try not to over-denature the essence of the Game Boy. I want to stick to the principles and practices universally approved by the chiptune community (I'm not saying this because I already tried to rebuild a Game Boy case from scratch and failed miserably).

, in order to create a product able to maintain the sound fidelity of the old processors.
