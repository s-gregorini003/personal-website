##Currently

I am a student at Leeds Beckett University, expecting to obtain a degree of MSc in Audio Engineering in July 2020. I've already submitted all the assignment apart from the final project, and my average is 74,9/100.

##Previous Achievements

1. I completed the following MOOCs on Coursera:
- [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://coursera.org/share/d7622e4151c541ad2476837b524214d5) by Deeplearning.ai
- [Machine Learning](https://coursera.org/share/afdf9bb56bce7d9c91a3a90d8382a69d) by Stanford University.

2. I designed and developed the Infrastructural Control Electronic System (ICES) for [GP2 S.r.l.](https://www.gp2.info/).

3. In 2018, I obtained a BSc degree in Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the University of Brescia (Italy), with a grade of 93/110 (equivalent to a 2:1 Honours) and a thesis titled "CoCr Alloys for Biomedical Applications Produced by Additive Manufacturing: Overview on Processes, Properties and Applications".

4. Towards the end of my Bachelors, I worked as an intern at [QPRO S.r.l.](https://www.qpro.it/). My tasks were to perform quality assurance on 3D printed metal components and to help with the maintenance of an [EOS M280](https://www.eos.info/en/additive-manufacturing/3d-printing-metal).

##Future Aims

I am looking for a PhD programme starting in autumn 2020 in deep learning applied to augmented and/or virtual reality. But I'm also considering to undertake internships, either before or whilst researching.

##Other Interests

Alongside the academic work, I have various passions and interests that often intertwine. Some of them are:
- 3D printing - Probably the interest most linked with all the others. With a 3D printer you can basically make everything
- Video Games - Both modern and retro gaming
- Chiptune - I restore and mod old consoles (mostly Game Boys) to compose and play music
- Music - I play drums discreetly, while guitar and bass are still a work in progress.
